Alright so it looks like I'm gonna have to go see about what it is all the kids are talking about in 2025.

**the goal:** to make a "neural network" with my bare hands and no libraries.

### Day 1:

First things first, I hear neural networks (NNs) need training data.
I think I want the MNIST handwritten digits; I've been told it's the `"Hello World!"` of NNs.
But when I went to go find it, I was immediately hit with some library bullshit.

Nonetheless, some light searching got me to the [raw files](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/mnist) (don't you just love the words "raw files"?), but it appears I can't quite decipher them...they're like, straight-up binary or something?

So TextEdit (macOS default text editor) isn't really a true fiend who looks at raw files with hex or binary encoding.
It's gonna want to use something woke, like UTF-8 or UTF-16.
So I asked a friend and he pointed me to [Hex Fiend](https://hexfiend.com), a true fiend.
A `5.4 MB` appâ€”pretty cool.
Now I can open the dataset and see a bunch of hex numbers!
And if I scale my window just right...

There are my numbers!
What is four bytes called? I think I'll call it a chomp.
Well, I think the first four chomps are telling me about the data.
It's a 3-dimensional array in *unsigned* bytes.
Each image is [`0x1C`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_(number)) by [`0x1C`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_(number)), and there are [`0xEA60`](./base.c) of them.

I need to read the file, or at least one image of it at a time.
On first attempt, C gave me some wrong numbers.
Fortunately, it was my time to become a man and learn about [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).
So the standard file-reading `fread()` is trying to read in little-Endian, but I need to read in big-Endian.
This is fixed with the following bit shifts:

```c
x = (x>>24) | ((x<<8) & 0x00FF0000) | ((x>>8) & 0x0000FF00) | (x<<24);
```
